/**
 * Below is the statement from BanditTest.  This test shows that the bug is in the algo
 *
 * The algorithm implementation has problems when all context features are 0, as the expected reward will always become 0
 * as well. It is currently not apparent if this is a problem of the implementation of the algorithm itself.
 *
 * This test shows that the bug is in the algorithm itself, per the question in that statement
 *
 * When this test is run with context {0,1} & {1,0}, with the bug, the following are the results, showing the 0,1 context has all arms tried equally
 * Context 1 best arm should be 2
 * Context 2 best arm should be 3
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 1 mean payoff is: 0.11176763895119775 <-- Same
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 2 mean payoff is: 0.11176763895119775 <-- Same
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 3 mean payoff is: 0.11176763895119775 <-- Same
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 4 mean payoff is: 0.11176763895119775 <-- Same
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 1 mean payoff is: 0.8568426093164598
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 2 mean payoff is: 0.8557385633927821
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 3 mean payoff is: 0.8571325948469687
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 4 mean payoff is: 0.8554355147371019
 * Trials p/Arm (best arm should have highest trial count):
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 1 trial count is: 12507.0 <-- Same
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 2 trial count is: 12507.0 <-- Same
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 3 trial count is: 12507.0 <-- Same
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 4 trial count is: 12507.0 <-- Same
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 1 trial count is: 267.0
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 2 trial count is: 244.0
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 3 trial count is: 49189.0
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 4 trial count is: 272.0
 *
 *
 * When this test is run with context {0,1} & {1,0}, with out the bug, the following are the results, showing the 0,1 context is correct, arm 2 has highest trial count
 * Context 1 best arm should be 2
 * Context 2 best arm should be 3
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 1 mean payoff is: 0.8555965432625908
 * Context ({0; 1}), Arm 2 mean payoff is: 0.8558525865686305

 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 1 mean payoff is: 0.8567006467150113
 * Context ({1; 0}), Arm 2 mean payoff is: 0.8564430307420418
